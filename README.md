## This is a Svelte implementation of my previous messenger clone I made this year. I was not satisfied with the
## code, so I'm starting fresh here!

### Built With

* [Svelte](https://reactjs.org)
* [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Netlify](https://bit.ly/3q4pcJz)
* [Cloundinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

### Requirements
* Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/MessengerV2`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Run `go build` to create a root level `MessengerV2.exe` file, and then run `.\MessengerV2` to run the executable. If an executable is not needed, simply input `go run main.go` instead, or `.\fresh` to enable a server restart on change.
* `cd` into the `client` folder, and run `npm run dev` to the Vite server, which should be on port 3000
